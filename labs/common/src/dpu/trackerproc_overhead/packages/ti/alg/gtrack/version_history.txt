MMWSDK-2315 Version 0.112
This release is unified tracker library version 0.112.
Release covers (matlab/mex and c sources), as well as all supported configurations)
Library is tested against 2DWM, 3DWM, and 3DCM configurations
Matlab results: 2DWM = 86.26, 3DWM = 97.78, 3DCM = 95.87
Mex results: 2DWM = 86.19, 3DWM = 97.78, 3DCM = 95.77
C/MSVC code passes autoregression for 2D and 3D.
Changes are related to allowing boresight filtering to be enabled/disabled from configuration instead of being always enabled for ceiling mount. This is to reduce boresight track loss in low density point cloud scenario (specifically in low bandwidth ceiling mount configuration).  
Summary of changes:
- Documentation file is updated.
- Added boresight filtering flag in config structure and used in gtrack_create and gtrack_step functions.
- Updated Matlab and C sources as well as Matlab, Mex and C tests to use the new parameter.

MMWSDK-1928 Version 0.108

This commit represents the library version that is tested against three sets of test vectors:
- 2D Wall mount, with 15 degree downtilt
- 3D Ceiling Mount (i.e. 90 degree downtilt), and
- 3D Wall mount with 15 degree downtilt

Code changes for 3D configurations:
- Since 3D configurations boxes are given in World coordinates, boundary checks are now performed by transforming tracker coordinates to the World. This is done by a rotation along the X axis followed by vertical move.
- 3D Ceiling mounting configuration is applied when elevation angle 90 +/-20 degrees
- 3D Wall mounting configurations are expected with 0-30 degrees elevation downtilt.
- Removed transformation of boundary/static/presence boxes. They stay in world coordinates.
- Added per point transformation to world coordinates to check for boundary/static/presence conditions

Code changes for 2D configuration:
- Transformations are skipped (tracking space = 2D World space)

Presence detection
- Allowed presence box to be specified, but the presence detection not. Setting the presence threshold to 0 points disables the presence detection. The same is achieved with no presence boxes specified.
- For existing targets, presence detection is getting measurement center, transforming to the world coordinates, and checking whether inside the presence box(es)
- Added diagnostic message for presence detection

Allocation
- Removed static points from allocation candidacy sets
- Modified isBehind function to increase solid angle (from 0.5 to 0.75)
- Allocation behind existing target is initialized with less confidence
-
Update
- Added an option for SNR-weighted average versus arithmetic mean when centroid estimate is computed
- Added an option to use max likelihood versus minimal distance (use log of error covariance matrix determinant or not)
- Simplified ghost centroid calculation
- Modified confidence update formula
- Modified minimal spread calculations (back to minSpread)
- Added debugging information with number of dynamic points the target is "interested"
- Added two parameters for minimal Cartesian velocity
- Added measurements center update and internal API to get it.

Event Management
- Detection state changes now requires reliable points
- Boundary/Static box checks are done in world coordinates, rotating/moving tracker position

API changes
- None. Clarified (doxygen) elevation tilt as "positive down" for 3D Wall mount. I.e. +15 degree is 15 degree downtilt

MMWSDK-1928 Version 0.107
Update to include presence detection module
Added Presence Detection interface
    - Updated matlab model
    - Updated mex functions mex_create and mex_step
    - Module level function is added to the set of functions called every frame
    - Benchmarking is extended to include presence detection
    - Parameters structure for presence detection includes: points threshold, approaching velocity, on to off counter, and occupancy box(es).
    - Similar to other boxes, occupancy box is rotated (if required) based on sensor elevation tilt.
    - Presnce indication is now returned by step functions
    - Step function API changed. Added a pointer to return presence

For consistnecy reasons, allocation and presence points threasholds are now ">=", so
    - configuration parameter of "20" points for allocation means "20 or more points",
    - configuration parameter of "3" points for presence detection means "3 or more points"
Removed obsolete structures (variation parameters)
Added measurement centroid (in cartesian coordinates) to the instance structure mainated by each unit.
Added a an API to obtain measurement centroid
Update function changes:
    - use simple "good points" mean (as opposed to SNR-weighted) to compute centroid
    - added computation of measurement centroid in cartesian
    - skip prediction is now based on absense of dynamic points

MMWSDK-1928 Version 0.106

    Changes to improve performance for 3D ceiling mount tracker.
    Performance is assessed based on the test suite of 10 test vectors in empty room with ODS sensor mounted at 2.8m height, facing down
    RF Layer velocity resolution 0.032m/s, range is 5.2m.
    PHY Layer is symmetrical, zooming based, followed by doppler compute.

    Changes in Tracker (specific for ceiling mount):
    - Cylindrical allocation is used. Meaning gating function is computed as normalized distance as projected to the horizontal plane
    - Ghost marking is disabled (for all 3D configurations)
    - Removed distribution determinant from scoring function for all configuration
    - Spread estimation filter constant changed from 0.90 (2D) to 0.95 (3D) to slow down the adaptation.
    - Added Box rotation based on elevation tilt parameter. This parameter shall be 90 +-10 (degrees) for celing mount configurations
    - Minimal static velocity for 3D configurations is measured in X/Z space, and is increased from 0.1m/s (2D) to 0.5m/s (3D)
    - Jacobian matrix is fixed. Partial derivative dx/d(elev) was not computed correctly
    - Min spread is set for [1m, 5deg, 5deg, 0.5m/s] for 3D configurations

MMWSDK-1928 Version 0.103
Changes to improve performance for 2D wallmount tracker.
Performance is assessed based on the test suite of 12 test vectors in cluttered room with significant multipath present.

1. Ghost marking
- Added definition for Likely Ghost points (250) and Behind Ghost Points (251).
- Likely Ghost points are the ones that associated with Ghost target, created by single multipath reflection.
- Behind Ghost points are the points that just are behind existing target, and can be the result of mulriple reflection paths.

2. Association process changes
- Points behind the existing targets are subject to competition between the Ghost Targets and real target.
- Points are won by the Ghost targets become Likely Ghost points (250). Otherwise, the are tagged as 251.
- Removed velocity unrolling logic
- Modified win/loss logic to include uniqueness handling for ghosts

3. Allocation process changes
- Allocation is not allowed for likely ghosts (250)
- Allocation is allowed for unique other ghost points (251)
- C implementation of allocation loop (clustering algorithm) is changed. C code algorithm is now same as matlab.

4. SNR threshold
- SNR threshold reaches max as range^4 at 2.5m, then goes linearly down to 1/3 of the max to range 1m, then stays constant
- Obscured thresholds is always scales with range^4

5. Update process changes
- Revereted to SNR-based weighting in centroid computing
- Spread filter constant changed from 0.01 to 0.05. This allows for faster spread adoptaion
- Minimal spread increased to +/-0.5m, +/-2.5deg, +/-0.25m/s
- Minimal static velocity threshold is changed from 0.5 to 0.1
- Estimated number of points is now computed based on number of reliable points
- Modified static condition entering. Both cases use same cartesian velocity threshold. Added slowdown logic to static point only case.

6. Events handling changes
- Targets outside of Boundary box are cleared with exit2free time
- Static targets with low confidence are cleared within exit2free time

7. Prediction process changes
- Added logic to skip process noise estimation (to handle the erasures)

Added track confidence level calculation
- Fast converging filter with alpha 0.1 is used.
- Confidence is defined as a ratio between number of reliable points and number dynamic points within Gate
- Confidence level is now reported in target description

MMWSDK-1071 Version 0.6
Added configuration option for the SNR threshold when candidate set is behind an existing target.
 - For people counting, one can set this SNR higher to deny ghosts behind the targtets;
 - For traffic monitoring, one can set this SNR lower to increase allocation chances for the obscured targets.
Added configuration for asymetric target acceleration.
 - For traffic monitoring, one can set the lateral acceleration small, and longitudinal acceleration large. This will allow tracker to better estimate target processing noise.
Added changes to sync matlab sources, C-Mex libraries, and C sources.
Added new file gtrack_unit_get to allow module level get unit level properties. Corresponding changes are added to C projects, and library makefiles
Cleaned up static handling. Added boolean isTargetStatic.
Process noise matrix is now based on asymtric acceleration properties is computed at start up only. No need to re-compute at update time.

Version 0.31
Fixed an error in moduleStep function
