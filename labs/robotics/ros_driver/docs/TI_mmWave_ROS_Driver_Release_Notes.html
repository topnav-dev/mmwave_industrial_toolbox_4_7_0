TI mmWave ROS Driver Release Notes
===================================

Overview
========

The TI mmWave ROS driver integrates the mmWave out-of-box demo with Robot OS (ROS) in Linux. It sets up a ROS service as an interface to configure the mmWave Evaluation Module and publishes a ROS PointCloud2 message with the objects detected when the sensor is activated.

Features
========

- Compatible with TI mmWave SDK v3.5 out-of-box demo when using IWR6843AOPEVM
- Compatible with TI mmWave SDK v3.5 out-of-box demo when using IWR6843 ES2.0 EVM
- Offers the out-of-box demo Command Line Interface (CLI) as a ROS Service
- Reads Radar data from the mmWave EVM and publishes it as a ROS PointCloud2 Message
- Outputs the {X,Y,Z} coordinate and intensity (snr) of each detected point in the ROS PointCloud2 Message
- {X,Y,Z} coordinates use the ROS standard coordinate system where X=forward, Y=left, Z=up (see http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html for more details)

Limitations
========================

The following is a list of known limitations for this release that were known at the time of release.
- Currently tested for the IWR6843 EVM and IWR6843AOPEVM only
- The mmWave EVM must be configured to only send the "detected objects¨ data. The other possible output data types such as "log magnitude range¨, "noise profile¨, heat maps, etc. are not currently supported by the ROS driver. Also, the Doppler/velocity field is not currently output in the ROS PointCloud2 Message.
