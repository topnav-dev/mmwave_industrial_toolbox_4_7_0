Autonomous Robotics with ROS for mmWave Release Notes
=============


Overview
========

This lab allows for the TI mmWave sensor to be used with popular mapping and
navigation libraries in the Robot Operating System (ROS) environment, familiar to
many robotics engineers. The lab uses the Octomap server and move_base libraries
with TI’s mmWave ROS Driver Package software interface to the TI mmWave sensor
IWR6843ISK EVM or the IWR6843AOP EVM running the mmWave
SDK out-of-box demo. With this TI driver and the software from the
ROS community (ros.org) engineers may evaluate robot navigation and object
avoidance quickly and easily.


Features
========

* Integrates the TI mmWave ROS driver into the ROS Turtlebot2 platform to allow
the TI mmWave sensor IWR6843ISK EVM, or TI mmWave sensor IWR6843AOP EVM to be used as a 3-D sensor
* Demonstrates mapping using the the TI mmWave sensor with the ROS Octomap
package
* Demonstrates navigation with collision-avoidance using the TI mmWave sensor
with the ROS move_base package 


New and Updated Features
========================

The following is a list of changes present in this version of the driver compared to
the previous release.
* Chirp profile config (.cfg) file name changed 'IWR6843ISK_3d_custom.cfg' to 'IWR6843ISK_3d.cfg'
* Chirp profile config (.cfg) added to support IWR6843AOP.
* Added note on editing configuration to Navigation Demo section of user's guide


Resolved Incident Reports
=========================

The following are Incident Reports resolved in this release:
* N/A


Known Limitations
============

The following are Known Limitations in this release:
* Currently supported/tested for IWR6843ISK
ES2.0 EVM, IWR6843AOP ES2.0 EVM only
* The mmWave EVM must be flashed with:
  * The mmWave SDK version 3.5 out-of-box demo firmware for IWR6843ISK ES2.0
  * The mmWave SDK version 3.5 out-of-box demo firmware for IWR6843AOP ES2.0
* The fake_localization ROS navigation package is used to allow direct setting of
the robot’s initial pose (position/orientation) and goal pose. Therefore, the
gmapping and amcl ROS navigation packages are not used.


Work Arounds for Major Known Issues
===================================

The following are workarounds for each known issue with a major severity that exists in this release:
* N/A

Changes in Version 1.8
========================

The following is a list of changes compared to the previous release.
- Added instructions on how to use 1843.
- Moved source code to https://git.ti.com/cgit/mmwave_radar/mmwave_ti_ros/

Changes in Version 1.7
========================

The following is a list of changes compared to the previous release.
- Changed cfg files to support SDK 3.5
- Merged source files from safety bubble lab into Autonomous robotics lab
- Added support for quad sensor operation
