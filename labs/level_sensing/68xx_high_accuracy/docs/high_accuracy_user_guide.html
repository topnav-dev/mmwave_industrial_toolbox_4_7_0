High Accuracy Range Measurement Lab
===========

This lab demonstrates the use of TI mmWave sensors for an application requiring a high degree of range accuracy. The **Zoom-FFT** technique is implemented to detect an object with range accuracy on the level of millimeters. A key application for this lab is fluid level sensing, although it may be useful in a variety of other applications including robotics, machinery, automotive, and even medical. 

[[b! 68xx Note
The 68xx version of this lab now includes a multipeak selection feature which returns three range measurements with high accuracy. This feature is not included on the 14xx, 16xx, or 64xx versions of the demo at this time.

-----------

#Theory

This lab is configured for one Tx antenna and one Rx antenna and utilizes the **Zoom FFT** technique which entails two steps. The first step involves taking a 1D *coarse* FFT in order to search for a peak. The second step involves a second **zoom-in** fft which analyzes the a portion of the peak spectrum at much higher resolution.

## Comparison between 64xx/14xx version and 16xx/68xx version

Since the 16xx/68xx devices include on-chip DSP, while the 14xx device does not, there are a few differences to note. The max FFT size on 64xx/14xx version is 16K due to hardware limitations of the on-chip FFT accelerator. Consequently the 64xx/14xx version will have much lower processing latency as well as lower power consumption. The 16xx/68xx version utilizes the on-chip DSP so resolution is much higher as well as a much larger FFT Size.

## 4. Run the Lab
### 1. Running the Lab GUI

[[b! Visualizer Note
The High Accuracy Visualizer has been updated as of Industrial Toolbox 4.7.0. Please use the latest visualizer as linked below.
]]

* Using Google Chrome connect to the [High Accuracy Visualizer.](https://dev.ti.com/gallery/view/4768107/High_Accuracy_Visualizer/ver/2.0.0/)

* ***If using the 64xx version of the lab then use the alternate [64xx High Accuracy Visualizer.](https://dev.ti.com/gallery/view/4768107/High_Accuracy_Visualizer_20200128013920/ver/1.0.0/)***

* If prompted, follow the on-screen instructions for installing [TI Cloud Agent](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ticloudagent-bridge/pfillhniocmjcapelhjcianojmoidjdk)

* Once the demo is loaded, go to **Options** → **Serial Port**

<img src="images/serialPort.png" width="400" />

* In the serial port window, enter the appropriate port in each of the drop down menus and click **Configure.** 

<img src="images/ports.png" width="500" />

* If using the IWR6843 AoP EVM, the ports are named differently. Select the correct port names as shown below.

<img src="images/mmwave_demo_visualizer_ports_aop.png" width="500" />


* Press **Load Config From PC and Send** and select the `high_accuracy_demo_<14/16/64/68>xx.cfg` from the `chirp_configs` folder.

* **Tip:** You may need to click the **Autoscale** button to frame the **Range Profile** correctly.

<img src="images/autoscale.png" width="500" />


### 2. Understanding the Output 

<img src="images/levelpic4.png" width="600" />

 The **Range Profile** shows the peaks of corresponding objects within the scene. The **X-Y Scatter Plot** illustrates the distance of the strongest detected object (or objects) on the y-axis and displays the range with millimeter precision. Appropriate mechanical mounting and/or optical lensing may be required in order to achieve millimeter level accuracy. 

<img src="images/levelpic2.png" width="600" />


 The **68xx version** of the lab includes a **multi-peak detection** feature where the Zoom-FFT measurement is performed on three distinct objects in the scene. The measurement is performed on each of the three *strongest* (or largest) peaks seen in the Range Profile. The colors red, blue, and green are used to distinguish the first, second, and third strongest peaks respectively. The colors are shown each on the middle y-axis in the left side plot and on the bottom x-axis in the right side plot.

 **NOTE:** The Multi-Peak feature is only avaiable on the 68xx version of the **High Accuracy Lab.**

#### Limiting Range

The user can use the **RangeLimitCfg** command in the `high_accuracy_demo_<14/16/64/68>xx.cfg` file to limit the range for their particular application.

The command **RangeLimitCfg** uses the following parameter structure `<numRangeBinZoomIn> <dis/enable> <min range limited> <max range limited>`, where:

* `<numRangeBinZoomIn > `(16xx/68xx only) : is the number of bins zoomed in on each side of coarse peak. *Note:* this is an optimized value and alteration is not recommended.
* `<dis/enable>` : 0 for disabled, 1 for enabled
* `<min range limited>` : in unit of meters
* `<max range limited>` : in unit of meters

<img src="images/rangelimit.png" width="200" />


***Example:***  In the above configuration, range limitation is enabled, the min range is 1.0m, and the max range is 3.0m.

### 2. Import Lab Project

To import the source code into your CCS workspace, CCS projects are provided for the High Accuracy Lab in the mmWave Industrial Toolbox. 
  
[[b! Project Workspace
When importing projects to a workspace, the files are COPIED into the workspace. All modifications will only be implemented for the workspace copy. The original project downloaded in mmWave Industrial Toolbox is not touched.
]]
  
- Start CCS and setup workspace as desired. 
- Import the project(s) specified below for the EVM platform to CCS. See instructions for importing [here](../../../../docs/readme.html#import-ccs-projects-from-the-mmwave-industrial-toolbox-into-code-composer-studio)  

Platform | Project Names             | Location in Industrial Toolbox    
----------|-------------------------|-----------------------------
14xx |high_accuracy_14xx_mss      | `<INDUSTRIAL_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_DIR>\mmwave_industrial_toolbox_<VER>\labs\level_sensing\14xx_high_accuracy\pjt`
16xx |high_accuracy_16xx_dss & high_accuracy_16xx_mss     | `<INDUSTRIAL_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_DIR>\mmwave_industrial_toolbox_<VER>\labs\level_sensing\16xx_high_accuracy\pjt`
64xx |high_accuracy_64xx_mss       |`<INDUSTRIAL_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_DIR>\mmwave_industrial_toolbox_<VER>\labs\level_sensing\64xx_high_accuracy\src`
68xx |high_accuracy_68xx_dss & high_accuracy_68xx_mss       |`<INDUSTRIAL_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_DIR>\mmwave_industrial_toolbox_<VER>\labs\level_sensing\68xx_high_accuracy\src`
68xxAoP |high_accuracy_68xx_dss & high_accuracy_68xx_mss      |`<INDUSTRIAL_TOOLBOX_INSTALL_DIR>\mmwave_industrial_toolbox_<VER>\labs\level_sensing\68xx_high_accuracy\src`

- Verify that the import occurred without error: in CCS Project Explorer the correct  project name should appear. 
   

[[r! Error during Import to IDE
  If an error occurs, check that the software dependencies listed above have been installed. Errors will occur if necessary files are not installed in the correct location for importing. 
]] 
  

### 3. Build the Lab

1. (16xx/68xx Version Only) First, select the DSS project `High_Accuracy_<device type>__dss` so it is highlighted. Right click on the project and select **Rebuild Project**. 
2. After the DSS project has succesfully built, select the MSS project `High_Accuracy_<device type>__mss` so it is highlighted. Right click on the project and select **Rebuild Project**. 
3. On successful build, the following should appear:
  * In `High_Accuracy_<device type>__dss/debug`, **`High_Accuracy_<device type>_dss.xe674`** (this is the C67x binary used for CCS debug mode) 
  * In `High_Accuracy_<device type>__mss/debug`, **`High_Accuracy_<device type>_mss.xer4f`** (this is the Cortex R4F binary used for CCS debug mode) and **`High_Accuracy_<device type>_lab.bin`** (this is the flashable binary used for deployment mode) 

{{y Selecting Rebuild instead of Build ensures that the project is always re-compiled. This is especially important in case the previous build failed with errors.}}

[[r! Build Fails with Errors
If the build fails with errors, please ensure that all the software requirements are installed as listed above and in the mmWave SDK release notes.
]]

[[b! Note
As mentioned in the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section, pre-built binary files, both debug and deployment binaries are provided in the pre-compiled directory of the lab.
]]

### 4. Execute the Compiled Lab

There are two ways to execute the compiled code on the EVM:
* **Deployment mode**: In this mode, the EVM boots autonomously from flash and starts running the bin image
    * Use the **`High_Accuracy_<device type>_lab.bin`**  found at `<CCS_PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\High_Accuracy_<device type>_mss\Debug\` and follow the same process in the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section except flash this binary instead.   
* **Debug mode**: This mode is is used for downloading and running the executable from CCS. This mode enables JTAG connection with CCS while the lab is running and is useful during development and debugging.
    * Follow the [CCS Debug Mode Guide](../../../common/docs/software_setup/using_ccs_debug.html), using the binaries listed below.
   * After CCS Debug mode is setup, launch the visualizer and proceed as described in the [Run the Lab section of the Quickstart](#4-run-the-lab)  
   
Debug binary   | Location | Connect and load to 
---------------|----------|----------------------
`High_Accuracy_<device type>_mss.xer4f`  |  `<CCS_PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\High_Accuracy_<device type>_mss\Debug\`   | Cortex_R4_0
`High_Accuracy_<device type>_dss.xe674`  |  `<CCS_PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\High_Accuracy_<device type>_dss\Debug\`   | C674X_0
