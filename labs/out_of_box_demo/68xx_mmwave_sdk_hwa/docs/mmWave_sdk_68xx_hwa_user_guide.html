  After using either method, the mmwave_sdk_68xx_mss project should be visible in **CCS Project Explorer**
  <img src="images/project_impt.png" width="400"/> 
]] 
  
[[b! Project Workspace
When importing projects to a workspace, a copy is created in the workspace. It is important to note that the copy in user's workspace is the one that gets built and all modifications will only be implemented for the workspace copy. The original project downloaded in mmWave Industrial Toolbox is not modified.
]]
  

### 3. Build the Lab

With the **mmwave_sdk_68xx_hwa**  project selected in **Project Explorer**, right click on the project and select **Rebuild Project**. 
  <img src="images/rebuild_project.png" width="400"/> 

{{y Selecting Rebuild instead of Build ensures that the project is always re-compiled. This is especially important in case the previous build failed with errors.}}

[[g! Successful Project Build
In the **Project Explorer** panel, navigate to and expand **mmwave_sdk_68xx_hwa &rarr; Debug** directory. On successfull build, the following files should appear in the **Debug** folder:
* xwr64xx_mmw_demo.bin  (this is the flashable binary used for deployment mode) 
* xwr64xx_mmw_mss.xer4f (this is the Cortex R4F binary used for CCS debug mode)
]]


[[r! Build Fails with Errors
If the build fails with errors, please ensure that all the [prerequisites](#software_requirements) are installed as mentioned in the mmWave SDK release notes.
]]

[[b! Note
As mentioned in the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section, pre-built binary files, both .xer4f and .bin, are provided in mmwave SDK under C:\ti\mmwave_sdk_03_04_xx_xx\packages\ti\demo\xwr64xx\mmw\.
]]

### 4. Execute the Lab

There are two ways to execute the compiled code on the EVM:
* **Deployment mode**: In this mode, the EVM boots autonomously from flash and starts running the bin image
    * Using Uniflash, flash the **xwr64xx_mmw_demo.bin** found at `<PROJECT_WORKSPACE_DIR>\mmwave_sdk_68xx_hwa\Debug\xwr64xx_mmw_demo.bin`  
	* The procedure to flash the EVM is the same as detailed in the [Flash the EVM](#flash_the_evm) section. 
* **Debug mode**: This mode is is used for downloading and running the executable (.xer4f) from CCS. This mode enables JTAG connection with CCS while lab is running; useful during development and debugging
     
  
[[+d Expand for help with Debug mode:
The CCS debug firmware (provided with the mmWave SDK) needs to be flashed once on the EVM. 
* CCS Debug method is enabled by flashing the CCS Debug Firmware (provided with the mmWave SDK) using the methods covered in the Quickstart [Flash the Device](#1-flash-the-evm) section.
* Use the following image instead       

Image           | Location     | Comment

### 5. Output from mmWave Demo Visualizer<br> and Output using DCA1000EVM
The mmWave Demo Visualizer is used to visualize processed output data from the mmWave radar device. This processed output data can be saved in binary form to a .DAT file. Additionally, raw ADC data can be saved for offline processing using the [DCA1000 EVM](https://www.ti.com/tool/DCA1000EVM).
To learn more about the structure of this output data please refer to the following resources:

[[b! Output Data versus Raw ADC Data
Output data refers to point cloud data (x,y,z,v). Raw ADC data refers to digitally sampled sensor data.
]]

* Output Data Structure Information:
  * `<MMWAVE_SDK_INTSALL_DIR>\packages\ti\demo\xwr68xx\mmw\docs\doxygen\html\index.html` 
* How to use the [DCA100EVM](https://www.ti.com/tool/DCA1000EVM) for raw data capture: 
  * `<MMWAVE_SDK_INTSALL_DIR>\docs\mmwave_sdk_user_guide.pdf` <br>Section 3.3.2 mmWave Demo with LVDS-Based Instrumentation
* Parsing Script Information for mmWave Demo Visualizer
  * `<MMWAVE_SDK_INTSALL_DIR>\docs\mmwave_sdk_user_guide.pdf` <br>Section 3.3.1 mmWave Demo - Advanced GUI Options
* Parsing Script Location for mmWave Demo Visualizer and [DCA100EVM](https://www.ti.com/tool/DCA1000EVM) for raw data capture:
  * `<MMWAVE_SDK_INTSALL_DIR>\packages\ti\demo\parser_scripts`

After running the lab using either method, the demo firmware should be executing on the EVM and waiting for sensor configuration. After this point, please follow the instructions provided in the [Quickstart](#run_the_lab) section to bring-up the mmWave Demo Visualizer for sending the configuration and visualizing the results.
