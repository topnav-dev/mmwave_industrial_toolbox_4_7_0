Version 1.1.0
=============

Overview
========

This lab demonstrates the use of TI mmWave sensors to count and track multiple people simultaneously, up to 50 meters away. Using the IWR6443 ES2.0 ISK, detection and tracking algorithms run onboard the device to localize people and track their movement with a high degree of accuracy. The algorithms are also set to ignore static objects such as poles or buildings, as well as filtering out objects such as trees which may move, but do not change position. The lab provides full source code and a CCS project and runs on the TI mmWave sensor IWR6443 ES2.0 ISK.
