Version 2.1.0
=============

**NOTE**: Due to the ongoing social distancing guidelines and TI policies, the scope of testing for this release was limited to 1-2 person tests. The underlying algorithm and implementation should be able to detect and track 5-7 people in the given coverage area but those tests are deferred for future releases once the guidelines allow for them.


Overview
========

This lab demonstrates the use of TI mmWave sensors to track and count people using the IWR6843ISK, IIWR6843ISK-ODS or IWR6843AOPEVM sensor module positioned in side-mount configuration (e.g. on a wall). Detection and tracking algorithms run onboard the IWR6843 mmWave sensor and are used to localize people and track their movement.The lab provides full source code and a CCS project and runs on the TI mmWave sensor IWR6843.

Features
========

The following features are supported:
* Supports IWR6843ISK-ODS antenna module (ES2.0)
* Supports IWR6843AOP antenna module (ES2.0, Rev F or later).
* GUI displays point cloud and tracking information
* Supports mmWave SDK 3.5

New and Updated Features
========================

The following features are new or updated in this release:

* **Documentation update:** The following new documents covering People Counting demo software implementation, Detection and Tracker layer parameter tuning, and Tracker algorithm and implementation details have been released in labs\people_counting\docs directory.

    1. 3D_people_counting_demo_implementation_guide.pdf
    2. 3D_people_counting_detection_layer_tuning_guide.pdf
    3. 3D_people_counting_tracker_layer_tuning_guide.pdf
    4. Tracking_radar_targets_with_multiple_reflection_points.pdf

* Updated config files to make boundaryBox and staticBoundaryBox parameters consistent. Also added presenceBoundaryBox configuration (this feature was already supported in code). 

Resolved Incident Reports
=========================

The following are Incident Reports resolved in this release:
* N/A

Known Issues
============

The following are Known Issues in this release:
* Device must be restarted for reconfiguration.
* Elevation Angle Estimation on ISK may be inaccurate compared to ODS due to lower elevation angular resolution provided by ISK
* Static Tracking within 2 meters of the device can be obscured by false static detections.
* High speed targets may not be detected.

Work Arounds for Major Known Issues
===================================

The following are workarounds for each known issue with a major severity that exists in this release:
* Ensure the staticBoundaryBox argument for NearY is 2 or greater.

Limitations
=========================

The following is a list of known limitations for this release that were known at the time of release:

* Due to the ongoing social distancing guidelines and TI policies, the scope of testing for this release was limited to 1-2 person tests. The underlying algorithm and implementation should be able to detect and track 5-7 people in the given coverage area but those tests are deferred for future releases once the guidelines allow for them.
