The experiment was performed outdoors in an empty parking lot, a corridor with low trees and shrubbery, and a parking lot with larger trees. In all scenarios, there was enough room that the test subject could enter and exit the effective range of the device at different angles and speeds.</p><h2 id="-setup-"><strong>Setup</strong></h2><p>The following setup was performed with an IWR1642BOOST EVM in a parking lot.</p><h3>Hardware Setup:</h3><ol><li>Testing was done in three separate locations.<ol><li>Empty Parking Lot</li><li>Corridor with low trees</li><li>Parking Lot with larger trees</li></ol></li><li>The IWR1642BOOST was mounted on a tripod at 2.25 meters<ol><li> The EVM was  tilted down 15 degrees. </li><li>A webcam was mounted on the tripod next to the EVM to show the base truth.  </li><li>Cones were placed in a straight line in front of the tripod-mounted EVM at 5 meter intervals.</li></ol></li><li>The People Counting demo was tested at different angles:<ol><li>Start point: -60 degrees</li><li>End Point: 60 degrees</li><li>Step Size: 15 degrees</li><li>0 degrees is bore-sight</li></ol></li><li>The target moved in three different ways:<ol><li>Walking: 1.5 m/s</li><li>Running: 7.5 m/s</li><li> Crouching: 1.5 m/s<ol><li>Lower RCS</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><h3>Software Setup:</h3><ol><li>The IWR1642BOOST EVM was calibrated using the technique described in the Out of Box Demo User's Guide.  </li><li>After calibration, the EVM was flashed with the Traffic Monitoring demo available in the mmWave Industrial Toolbox.<ol><li>This experiment was done with Industrial Toolbox version 2.5.1, which is the first version to incorporate changes to CFAR that improve detection at range. Please note that older versions of the software may have poorer performance at range.</li><li>The default install location of this demo is: C:\ti\mmwave_industrial_toolbox_2_5_1\labs\lab0013_traffic_monitoring_16xx\prebuilt_binaries\traffic_monitoring_16xx_lab.bin</li></ol></li><li>The People Counting GUI was used.

For example, as long as the human returns a detection point, the device can maintain a track on the object, but to allocate a track, it requires 4 detection points for five consecutive frames.</p><table class="table table-striped table-bordered"><tbody><tr><th>Angle (degrees)</th><th>Detection Range Departing (m)</th><th>Detection Range Approaching (m)</th><th>Speed</th><th>Vmax Extension Enabled</th></tr><tr><td>-60</td><td>25</td><td>12</td><td>Walking</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>-45</td><td>32</td><td>21</td><td>Walking</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>-30</td><td>41</td><td>33</td><td>Walking</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>-15</td><td>56</td><td>41</td><td>Walking</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>56</td><td>48</td><td>Walking</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>56</td><td>40</td><td>Walking</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>42</td><td>35</td><td>Walking</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>45</td><td>32</td><td>24</td><td>Walking</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>60</td><td>18</td><td>7</td><td>Walking</td><td>NA</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Walking away from device at bore-sight:</p><p><img style="height:250;" src="./images/Detecting+Humans+at+50+Meters+and+Filtering+False+Detections+with+GTrack+Software/50mborewalkout.gif" class="img-responsive"></p><p>Walking toward the device at bore-sight:</p><p><img style="height:250;" src="./images/Detecting+Humans+at+50+Meters+and+Filtering+False+Detections+with+GTrack+Software/50mborewalkin.gif" class="img-responsive"></p><p><br></p><h3>Running Results:</h3><p>The running test was performed at bore-sight, with Vmax extension enabled and with Vmax extension disabled.</p><table class="table table-striped table-bordered"><tbody><tr><th>Angle (degrees)</th><th>Detection Range Departing (m)</th><th>Detection Range Approaching (m)</th><th>Speed</th><th>Vmax Extension Enabled</th></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>50</td><td>20</td><td>Running</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>50</td><td>21</td><td>Running</td><td>Yes</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Running Away from device at bore-sight:</p><p><img style="height:250;" src="./images/Detecting+Humans+at+50+Meters+and+Filtering+False+Detections+with+GTrack+Software/50mborerunout.gif" class="img-responsive"></p><p>Running toward device at bore-sight:</p><p><img style="height:250;" src="./images/Detecting+Humans+at+50+Meters+and+Filtering+False+Detections+with+GTrack+Software/50mborerunin.gif" class="img-responsive"></p><h3>Sneaking Result:</h3><p>The sneaking test was performed once, with a crouching human slowly departing then approaching the device at bore-sight.  The lower RCS of a sneaking person made detection more difficult for the device.</p><table class="table table-striped table-bordered"><tbody><tr><th>Angle (degrees)</th><th>Detection Range Departing (m)</th><th>Detection Range Approaching (m)</th><th>Speed</th><th>Vmax Extension Enabled</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1">0</td><td colspan="1">56</td><td colspan="1">28</td><td colspan="1">Slow Walking/Sneaking</td><td colspan="1">No</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Sneaking toward device at bore-sight:</p><p><img style="height:250;" src="./images/Detecting+Humans+at+50+Meters+and+Filtering+False+Detections+with+GTrack+Software/50mboreSneakIn.gif" class="img-responsive"></p><h2 id="-false-detection-mitigation-results--">False Detection Mitigation Results:</h2><p>Two environments were tested for false detection mitigation. In both locations, trees and other plants are blown around by the wind, resulting in the radar returning detected points to the GTrack software. By intelligently grouping and tracking the detected points, the software can successfully track the human without tracking the trees and shrubs.</p><p>In the first scene, a person approaches the IWR1642BOOST device in a parking lot. Trees and bushes in and around the parking lot are blown in the wind, causing a very noisy point cloud. You can see that only the person is tracked.</p><p><img style="height:250;" src="./images/Detecting+Humans+at+50+Meters+and+Filtering+False+Detections+with+GTrack+Software/50mTreeParkingLot.gif" class="img-responsive"></p><p>In the second scene, a person walks away from the IWR1642BOOST. Small trees to the left and above the person are blowing in the wind, creating many detection points. Again, GTrack filters out the trees and only the person is tracked.</p><p><img style="height:250;" src="./images/Detecting+Humans+at+50+Meters+and+Filtering+False+Detections+with+GTrack+Software/50mTreeCorridor.gif" class="img-responsive"></p><p>In these scenes, the "noisy" point cloud takes different forms. In the first scene, large trees and dense bushes create localized point clouds that have tight clusters in a single location. In the second scene, the overhanging trees create a more sporadic, spread out point cloud. In both environments, the GTrack software is able to successfully track the human target with tracking trees or bushes.</p><h2 id="-conclusion-"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><ol><li>This experiment demonstrates the ability of the IWR1642BOOST to detect people as far away as 50 meters. This capability could be used in application such as IPNC to reliably detect people. </li><li>One device can be used to monitor a large area, reducing the number of cameras and personnel required to monitor an area.</li><li>GTrack allows static shrubbery and trees to be easily filtered out, reducing false detections in challenging environments.</li></ol><p><br></p><p><br><br></p><p><br></p></div>
