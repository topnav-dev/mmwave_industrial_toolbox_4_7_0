        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-9" id="content"><h1 id="-introduction-"><strong>Introduction</strong></h1><p>The objective of this experiment is to demonstrate the ability to detect gesture motions using a TI mmWave Sensor EVM through two impediments, glass and smoke. Two types of gesture motions were tested, a finger twirl motion and hand double swipe motion. Gestures were performed both without any impediment and then with the impediment introduced in between the sensor and the gestures. </p><h1 id="-setup-nbsp--"><strong>Setup </strong></h1><p>The setup for this experiment can be divided into two parts, namely physical setup and software setup. These are detailed below:</p><h2 id="-physical-setup-">Physical Setup</h2><p>The physical setup includes information about the scene such as the distance between the target and the sensor antenna, the type of target used, hardware setup and any other physical considerations e.g. non-reflective surfaces or use of anechoic chamber etc. The physical setup used for this experiment is given below:</p><p>The following cases were tested for each of the two gestures:</p><table class="table table-striped table-bordered"><tbody><tr><th colspan="1"><br></th><th>Glass Impediment</th><th>Smoke Impediment</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><strong>Control</strong></td><td>Glass Sliding door open</td><td>Fog machine off</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1"><strong>Test Case</strong></td><td>Glass sliding door closed</td><td>Fog machine on and producing smoke</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p><p><strong>Glass Impediment Setup</strong></p><ol><li>The experiment was performed on a home patio with a sliding glass door.</li><li>An IWR1443 EVM was mounted on a tripod and placed with the sensor parallel to the glass door and 5cm from the glass.</li><li>The target was the hand making the gesture motion.

However, the degree to which this affects gesture recognition capabilities can be tuned by considering sensor parameters as well gesture recognition algorithm parameters.</li></ol></div>
