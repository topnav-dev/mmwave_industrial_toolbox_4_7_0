The angle of the EVM is also changed in the chirp configuration.</li><li>We tuned the required SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) in the Allocation Parameters section of the People counting code. This can be find in task_app.c under MSS in the project folder. This change was made after observing the initial performance of the demo with plywood obstruction.. The threshold was lowered to 200 SNR.  This change did not cause adverse performance in any other scenario, so all tests were performed with the lower 200 SNR threshold.<br><img style="" src="./images/People+Counting+through+Plastic+and+Drywall+and+Wood/code_snippet.JPG" class="img-responsive"></li></ol><p>The experiment was conducted as follows:</p><ol><li>One person (the proctor) sits in the room and begins the recording.</li><li>The proctor calls for two more participants to enter the room.</li><li>The other two participants enter one by one.</li><li>Once all the participants have entered the room, the recording is ended.</li><li>This is repeated for each scenario.</li></ol><p>During the course of the experiment, the People Counting software was left running. We did not pause the software to tune any parameters after the initial tuning.</p><h1 id="-results-"><strong>Results</strong></h1><p><strong><br></strong>Results for this experiment were generally favorable with minimal amounts of interference due to the obstruction. However, the plywood proved the most difficult to detect objects through. We tuned the minimum required SNR before the experiment to account for that. The double drywall scenario created some reflections noticable in the video as well. </p><h2 id="-control-no-obstruction--">Control (No obstruction)</h2><p>You can see the performance of the tracking software under normal conditions. There is one participant out of frame, one sitting in the chair, and one who enters through the door way. The software successfully detects all three participants.</p><p><img style="" src="./images/People+Counting+through+Plastic+and+Drywall+and+Wood/control_uniform.gif" class="img-responsive"></p><h2 id="-birch-plywood-obstruction-">Birch Plywood Obstruction</h2><p>The plywood caused difficulty for the tracker because it lowered the SNR of the point cloud. We were able to tune the tracker to properly track the participants by lowering the required SNR threshold form 250 to 200 in the  Allocation Parameters section of the People counting code. By lowering this threshold, the tracker could classify point clouds with lower cumulative SNRs as people.</p><p><img style="" src="./images/People+Counting+through+Plastic+and+Drywall+and+Wood/plywood_uniform.gif" class="img-responsive"></p><h2 id="-plexiglas-obstruction-">Plexiglas Obstruction</h2><p>The plexiglas obstruction had no noticable effect on the performance of the people counting software.</p><p><img style="" src="./images/People+Counting+through+Plastic+and+Drywall+and+Wood/plexiglas_resized.gif" class="img-responsive"></p><h2 id="-drywall-obstruction-">Drywall Obstruction</h2><p>The single piece of drywall had no noticable impact on the performance of the tracking software.</p><p><img style="" src="./images/People+Counting+through+Plastic+and+Drywall+and+Wood/drywall_uniform.gif" class="img-responsive"></p><h2 id="-two-layers-of-drywall-as-obstruction-">Two Layers of Drywall as Obstruction</h2><p>Two pieces of drywall caused some poor behavior from the tracker. As the first participant enters the doorway, he is tracked before entering the room, despite being out of the field of view of the EVM. The tracker creates another track when the participant fully enters the room, leaving a ghost track for a few seconds before determining no human is there. The second layer of drywall caused an increase in the number of reflections, leading to this phenomenon.  Also notice the seated participant is dropped by the tracker because he was still enough to appear as a static object.  The tracking software consciously ignores static objects to avoid classifying tables and chairs as people.  Note that he is picked back up by the tracker after moving.</p><p><img style="" src="./images/People+Counting+through+Plastic+and+Drywall+and+Wood/2xdrywall_resized.gif" class="img-responsive"></p><p><br></p><h2 id="-summary-">Summary</h2><table class="table table-striped table-bordered"><tbody><tr><th style="text-align: center;"><br></th><th style="text-align: center;">Test 1</th><th colspan="1">Test 2</th><th colspan="1">Test 3</th><th colspan="1">Test 4</th></tr><tr><th style="text-align: center;">Obstruction Type</th><td>Birch Plywood</td><td colspan="1">Plexiglas</td><td colspan="1">Drywall (1 Layer)</td><td colspan="1">Drywall (2 Layers)</td></tr><tr><th style="text-align: center;">Results</th><td>Performance was maintained after lowering SNR threshold to 200 from 250.</td><td colspan="1">Performance was maintained.</td><td colspan="1">Performance was maintained.</td><td colspan="1">Ghosting.

This can enable more creative installations and applications of people counting and motion detection systems such as those that are hidden from view or protected from the environment.</li><li>The ability to tune the People Counting Software to improve performance with the plywood obstruction demonstrates the ability of mmWave technology to be quickly adapted to a new environment.</li></ol><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong><br></strong></p></div>
